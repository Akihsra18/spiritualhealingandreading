                                        I am a Reiki practitioner, an initiate of Munay-Ki shamanic rites, tarot reader, higher self message reader, 
                                        professional space healer, an Akashic records reader and chakra reader and healer.
                                        I got my spiritual awakening in 2012, when I started to be intuitive and receive messages from the higher realms. 
                                        As an Akashic records reader, I aim to help people to know about the story of their soul. 
                                        And as a space healer, I help people in clearing out negative energies at their property, 
                                        and instruct them on how to protect the property against negative energies in future. 
                                        As a tarot reader, I channel your angels to find answers from your questions about your life situation. 
                                        And as a higher self message reader, I channel your higher self and find answers from your questions about your spiritual life
                                        and guide you how to bring you in alignment with your higher self. As a chakra reader and healer, I aim to know 
                                        which chakras are out of balance and heal them to improve your physical, emotional and mental health. As a shamanic 
                                        reader, I aim to understand the story of your fate, destiny, and free will; and allow you to chart a course 
                                        to live a life of deep purpose, true prosperity, and vibrant love.
