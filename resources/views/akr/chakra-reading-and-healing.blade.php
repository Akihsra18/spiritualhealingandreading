                                There are seven main chakras that run along our spine. These chakras work as energy 
                                vortices that regulate our body's energy and the connection between our different bodies 
                                (physical, spiritual, mental, and energetic) and our environment. When our chakras are out 
                                of balance or blocked, they have negative impact on our physical, emotional and mental health. 
                                We may feel unsafe, unsupported, disconnected, lonely, low self-esteem, and more. With the 
                                chakra reading and healing, we aim to know which chakras are out of balance and heal or balance them.

                                your physical, emotional and mental health.
